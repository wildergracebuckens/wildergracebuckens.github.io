    <h2>A Little Bit About Me</h2>
    <p>I was born yesterday (well, almost). Actually,it was March 31, 2021 at 6:43pm in New York City.I have a dog named Evie and I like to
      eat, sleep and think deep thoughts (all of which you can clearly see from this picture, where I have just eaten, am sleeping, and simultaneously thinking deep thoughts). I look forward to learning how to talk so I can share these thoughts with the world at large.</p>
    <h2>How I chose My Personal Logo</h2>
    <p>Let’s get this straight: I did not choose a buzzy bee as my personal logo.The people who set this up thought that even a first time web site should have a professional looking logo and, as they hadn’t met me yet, they went with something both wild and graceful in tribute to my name. I plan to change this as soon my Dad teaches me to code.</p>
    <h2>Coming Soon</h2>
    <p>I know this is very exciting, my arrival on the scene, and I realize people are waiting to see what I’ve got planned.Well, first I need to meet some people on both coasts (meetings are already in the works) and then I have to spend some time developing a few necessary skills (walking, talking, and coding as mentioned earlier). Once a few of these logistical hurdles are in the rearview mirror, I will begin to tease at my long term strategy for the next, oh, say eighteen years or so.</p>
    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>For those of you who want to get in touch, you should probably go through my parents at this early stage.Their details will be forthcoming once I get hold of my mom’s iPhone. But FYI, that’s probably at least 6 months off as it’s hard to pry it away from her and I’m just starting to work on my eye-hand coordination.</p>
